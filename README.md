# 🥖 BreadRescue - Fight Bread Waste and Reward the Community

## 🌍 Project Context

**BreadRescue** is a decentralized platform designed to combat **bread waste** and promote **community engagement**.  
In France, over **150,000 tons of bread** are wasted every year — about **9 baguettes per person**.  
Meanwhile, many people (students, retirees, modest families) are ready to **rescue** this edible bread, but lack the means and recognition.

Inspired by sustainable values and blockchain transparency, BreadRescue combines **AI, Hedera blockchain, and community action** to reward responsible behavior and reduce waste.
